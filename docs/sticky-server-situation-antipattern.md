# The Sticky Server Situation Anti-Pattern

## Definition
The "Sticky Server Situation" anti-pattern in REST API design refers to maintaining session state on the server, which goes against RESTful principles and can cause scaling and reliability issues.

## Origin of the Name
The name "Sticky Server Situation" highlights how servers become "sticky" with client-specific state, making it difficult to distribute requests across multiple servers and scale horizontally.

## The Problem
1. **Lack of Statelessness**: Violates the REST principle of stateless communications between client and server.

2. **Scalability Issues**: Makes it challenging to scale horizontally as requests from a specific client must always go to the same server.

3. **Reduced Reliability**: If a server goes down, all session data for its clients is lost.

4. **Increased Server Load**: Servers must manage and store session data, increasing memory usage and complexity.

5. **Difficulty in Caching**: Stateful interactions are harder to cache effectively.

## Examples
1. **Authentication Scenario**:
   - Bad (Sticky Server): 
     ```
     POST /login
     // Server creates a session and returns a session ID
     GET /api/user-data
     // Client sends session ID, server looks up session
     ```
   - Better: 
     ```
     POST /login
     // Server returns a JWT token
     GET /api/user-data
     // Client sends JWT token in Authorization header
     ```

2. **Shopping Cart**:
   - Bad (Sticky Server):
     ```
     POST /cart/add
     // Server stores cart in session
     GET /cart
     // Server retrieves cart from session
     ```
   - Better:
     ```
     POST /cart-items
     // Client sends cart item to be added
     GET /cart-items?userId=123
     // Server retrieves cart items for user
     ```

## How to Avoid
1. **Token-Based Authentication**: Use JWT or similar tokens instead of server-side sessions.
2. **Client-Side State Management**: Keep transient state (like shopping carts) on the client side when possible.
3. **Distributed Caching**: If server-side state is necessary, use distributed caching systems.
4. **Resource-Based Design**: Model stateful entities as resources with their own URLs.
5. **Idempotent Operations**: Design operations to be idempotent, allowing for safe retries without server-side state.

## Trade-offs
While avoiding the "Sticky Server Situation" is generally beneficial, consider:
- Potential increase in request payload size due to tokens or client-side state.
- Need for more complex client-side state management.
- Possible security considerations with client-side storage of sensitive data.

Balance is key â€“ aim for a stateless design that enhances scalability and reliability, while still providing a smooth user experience.
