# The Russian Doll Scheme Anti-Pattern

## Definition
The "Russian Doll Scheme" anti-pattern in REST API design refers to creating deep, nested URL structures that attempt to model complex resource relationships, resulting in overly verbose and difficult-to-use APIs.

## Origin of the Name
The name "Russian Doll Scheme" comes from the Russian nesting dolls, where each doll contains a smaller one inside. Similarly, this anti-pattern creates URLs with multiple levels of nesting, each representing a resource contained within another.

## The Problem
1. **Overly Complex URLs**: URLs become long, hard to read, and difficult to construct manually.

2. **Inflexibility**: Deeply nested structures make it challenging to access resources independently of their parents.

3. **Performance Issues**: Retrieving deeply nested resources may require multiple database queries, impacting performance.

4. **Versioning Difficulties**: Changes in resource relationships can break existing URL structures.

5. **Limited Scalability**: As the API grows, the nested structure can become unwieldy and hard to maintain.

## Examples
1. **E-commerce Product Review Scenario**:
   - Bad (Russian Doll Scheme): 
     ```
     GET /stores/123/departments/456/categories/789/products/101112/reviews/131415
     ```
   - Better: 
     ```
     GET /reviews/131415?product=101112
     ```

2. **Document Management System**:
   - Bad (Russian Doll Scheme):
     ```
     POST /organizations/1/projects/2/folders/3/subfolders/4/documents
     ```
   - Better:
     ```
     POST /documents
     {
       "name": "New Document",
       "folderId": 4
     }
     ```

## How to Avoid
1. **Flat Resource URLs**: Keep URLs as flat as possible, using query parameters to filter or relate resources.
2. **Resource Identifiers**: Use unique identifiers for resources that don't require the full hierarchy in the URL.
3. **Hypermedia Links**: Use HATEOAS principles to provide related resource URLs in responses.
4. **Query Parameters for Relationships**: Use query parameters to specify related resources instead of deep nesting.
5. **Composite Resources**: Create composite resources that aggregate related data when frequently needed together.

## Trade-offs
While avoiding the "Russian Doll Scheme" is generally beneficial, consider:
- Potential loss of explicit representation of resource hierarchies in URLs.
- Need for additional documentation to explain resource relationships.
- Possible increase in the number of endpoints for very complex systems.

Balance is key â€“ aim for an API structure that is intuitive and flexible, while still representing important resource relationships clearly.
